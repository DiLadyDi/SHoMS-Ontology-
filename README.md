# SHoMS Ontology

The Smart Home Management System (SHoMS) Ontology was developed as a part of a university research project at Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU).

SHoMS ontology is built upon the IoT-Lite ontology.  
It was designed as a conceptual model explaining the smart home management system domain. 
It provides information on the main components of such systems with a big focus on the whole scope of services that can be potentially offered by such systems.  

The ontology may be of interest to people who would like to get a deeper understanding of smart home management systems 
as well as smart home systems designers and developers who may use the ontology to better understand user’s desires and pain points to improve existing systems 
and to develop comprehensive, all-in-one smart home management systems that provide a customer with a vast range of services and functionalities.  

SHoMS ontology has been published on the Github repository to assure collaboration between developers for further refinement, 
extension and reuse of the smart home management system ontology.

Moreover, the ontology is supported by the research paper "Smart Home Management Systems: from Conceptual Model to Improved Customer Experience" that can be also found in the repository. 


### Paper Abstract:
The paper aims at providing insights on knowledge, experi-ence and attitude of people towards smart home management systems aswell as analyzing the domain and assessing the current solutions that arepresent on the market. First of all, in-depth semi-structured interviewsare conducted to find out insights on people’s perception of smart homemanagement systems. Then a formal ontology is designed that may beused as a conceptual model for a smart home management system. Fi-nally, the score model is composed to compare the most popular systems.The  analysis  also  includes  the  description  of  the  perspective  standardthat may contribute to the development of the smart home technology.The deliverables of the study may help people to understand smart homesystems better in terms of decision making, choosing the right product tobuy and regular usage. Also, the research aims to support developers ofsmart home products by focusing their attention on the Human-CenteredDesign aspects as well as the whole set of functionalities and services re-quired by the users and available from the technology perspective.
