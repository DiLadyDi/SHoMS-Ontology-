# SHoMS-Ontology-
The Smart Home Management System (SHoMS) Ontology was developed as a part of a student university research project at Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU).
The ontology is supported by the research paper that can be also found in the repository. 

SHoMS ontology is built upon the IoT-Lite ontology.  
It was designed as a conceptual model explaining the smart home management system domain. 
It provides information on the main components of such systems with a big focus on the whole scope of services that can be potentially offered by such systems.  
The ontology may be of interest to people who would like to get a deeper understanding of smart home management systems 
as well as smart home systems designers and developers who may use the ontology to better understand userâ€™s desires and pain points to improve existing systems 
and to develop comprehensive, all-in-one smart home management systems that provide a customer with a vast range of services and functionalities.  

The SHoMS ontology has been published on the Github repository to assure collaboration between developers for further refinement, 
extension and reuse of the smart home management system ontology.
